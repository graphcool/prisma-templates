# GCP templates

This collection of templates is intended to be used with GPC Deployment Manager.

How to use:
* Currently a work in progress. There seems to be some bugs around GKE and Deployment Manager that the Google team are working on.
* Essentially this template is a two step process for creating re-usable deployment
templates on GCP. We start by creating the cluster and a custom type to create concepts with, and then move
to the actual service definitions for GKE.
